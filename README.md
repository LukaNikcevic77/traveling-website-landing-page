# traveling-website-landing-page
This is the webpage made by the design provided by odin project. Sole focus was on flexbox, or using it to build almost everything without paying too much attention to scaling 
or fiting mobile devices(The course didnt cover media query or frameworks like bootrstap for this use). It took me 4 hours to finish it with light work and pauses between work.
I could have made css more tidy by defining properties but course didnt cover it yet so I didnt use it. Last but not least I would like to give credits to these amazing photographers
whose photos I used for my website:
--- France | Matt Hardy 
--- Spain | Enrico Perini
--- Portugal | Julie Aagaard
--- England | Dominika Gregushova
--- First section image | Gabriela Palai
